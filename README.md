### About Gibbs Sampler
Gibbs Sampler is an algorithm of many MCMC(Markov Chain Monte Carlo) technique to approximate sequence of observations which are sampled from multivariate probability distributions.
As it requires assumptions of prior distributions, Gibbs Sampler is a Bayesian inference.

### Report
The report contains an algorithm of Gibbs Sampler and its application to classification problem in machine learning.
Its performance is compared to other commonly used classification methods. The report contains limits of the Gibbs Sampler that I implemented which should be improved in future researches.
