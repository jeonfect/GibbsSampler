### About Gibbs Sampler
Gibbs Sampler is an algorithm of many MCMC(Markov Chain Monte Carlo) technique to approximate sequence of observations which are sampled from multivariate probability distributions.
As it requires assumptions of prior distributions, Gibbs Sampler is a Bayesian inference.

Information of how the implementation of the Gibbs Sampler code is done is explained in separate report. 
The report contains an algorithm of Gibbs Sampler and its performance compared to other commonly used machine learning techniques for classification.
